Project (N)avigating (A)ccelerometer (P)atterns for (S)leep
A.K.A. Project NAPS

# Goal
This repository is for the [Child Mind Institute's - Detect Sleep States Project](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/child-mind-institute-detect-sleep-states) on Kaggle.

The goal of this project is to analyze wrist-worn accelerometer data and classify it into two types of events related to a personâ€™s sleep state: (1) onset: the beginning of sleep, and (2) wakeup: the end of sleep.

# Project Information
The principal dataset is provided by the Healthy Brain Network (partnered with the **Child Mind Institute**) [1] and comprises 500 multi-day recordings of wrist-worn accelerometer data annotated with the two event types (onset and wakeup). Each data series represents a continuous (multi-day/event) recording for a unique experimental subject. Note that since this is a competition, we do not have access to the competition's test set, however a different test series is provided to us. The final submission deadline for the competition is **December 5th**.
